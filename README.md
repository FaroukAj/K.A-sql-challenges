The repository contains my solutions to the SQL challenges from Khan Academy. The challenges cover a range of topics, from basic SQL queries to more advanced topics like JOINs and subqueries.

Each challenge is presented with a set of requirements and a database schema, and the learner is required to write SQL queries to satisfy the requirements. I have included my solutions to each challenge in this repository, along with any additional notes or explanations that I thought might be helpful.

By sharing my solutions to these challenges, I hope to provide other learners with an additional resource for studying SQL. Whether you're just starting out with SQL or looking to improve your skills, these challenges can help you practice writing SQL queries and gain a deeper understanding of how to work with relational databases.

Feel free to explore the repository and use my solutions as a reference as you work through the challenges. And if you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out!
